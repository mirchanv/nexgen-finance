# NexGen Finance - Interactive Banking Dashboard

A dynamic, single-page web application built with modern **`JavaScript (ES6+)`** and styled with **`Tailwind CSS`**. This project simulates a real-world online banking experience, focusing on interactive data manipulation, state management, and a responsive, user-friendly interface.

# Key Features Implemented:

- **`Secure User Authentication:`** Client-side login/logout functionality with personalized UI and welcome messages.

- **`Dynamic Transaction Display:`** Fetches and displays user transaction history, with features for sorting movements and formatting dates based on user locale (Intl.DateTimeFormat).

- **`Real-Time Financial Calculations:`** Automatically computes and displays account balance, total deposits, withdrawals, and interest earned using advanced array methods.

- **`Core Banking Operations:`** Implemented features for transferring funds between accounts, requesting loans (with validation logic), and closing an account.

- **`Session Management:`** An automatic logout timer enhances security by ending the user session after a period of inactivity.

- **`Interactive UI/UX:`** Provides instant user feedback through audio notifications for success/error states and smooth UI transitions for a modern user experience.

- **`Internationalization (i18n):`** Formats currency and dates according to the user's specific locale and currency standards (Intl.NumberFormat).

# Tech Stack & Skills Demonstrated:

- **`JavaScript (ES6+):`**

  - **Advanced Array Methods:** Extensive use of map, filter, reduce, find, some, and forEach for complex data manipulation.
  - **DOM Manipulation & Events:** Full control over the UI through JavaScript event listeners and dynamic HTML rendering.
  - **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Utilized `setTimeout` and `setInterval` to manage session timers and simulate processing delays.
  - **Internationalization API:** Leveraged Intl object for robust date, time, and currency formatting.
  - **Modular Code:** Organized logic into reusable functions for maintainability and clarity.

- **`Tailwind CSS:`**
  - Implemented a fully responsive, utility-first design for a clean and modern interface.
  - Created custom components and layouts using Tailwind's grid, flexbox, and styling utilities.
- **`HTML5 & CSS3:`**
  Structured the application with semantic HTML5.
  Enhanced the UI with custom CSS for features like animated borders and scrollbars.

- **`Web Development Concepts:`**
  - **Single Page Application (SPA):** Built a fluid, single-page experience without page reloads.
  - **Client-Side State Management:** Managed application state (current user, login status) entirely on the front-end.
